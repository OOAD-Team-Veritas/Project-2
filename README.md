Our output file:
[out.txt](/out.txt)

+ a) We rewrote this program using C++.

+ b) Strategy pattern was used for Animal noise and roam behavior. 

+ c) Observer pattern was used to make ZooAnnouncer functionality.

Implementation was put into header files of classes in order to decrease the # of files involved in this project (and to
make it easier for both us and the grader). While this is a departure in C++ standards, we believe it was justified 
for this project.
